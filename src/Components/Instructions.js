  <h2>Cleansing:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><h5>Normal skin:</h5> Use a gentle cleanser to remove dirt, oil, and impurities.</li>
    <li><h5>Dry skin:</h5> Opt for a hydrating or creamy cleanser that won't strip the skin of its natural oils.</li>
    <li><h5>Oily skin:</h5> Look for a foaming or gel-based cleanser that can help control excess oil.</li>
    <li><h5>Combination skin:</h5> Use a cleanser that targets both oily and dry areas, such as a gentle foaming cleanser.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Toning:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><h5>Normal skin:</h5> A mild toner can help balance the skin's pH levels.</li>
    <li><h5>Dry skin:</h5> Use a hydrating toner to soothe and moisturize the skin.</li>
    <li><h5>Oily skin:</h5> Look for a toner that helps control oil production and minimizes the appearance of pores.</li>
    <li><h5>Combination skin:</h5> Use a toner that addresses both oily and dry areas of the skin.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Moisturizing:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><h5>Normal skin:</h5> Use a lightweight, non-greasy moisturizer to keep the skin hydrated.</li>
    <li><h5>Dry skin:</h5> Opt for a rich, nourishing moisturizer that provides deep hydration.</li>
    <li><h5>Oily skin:</h5> Look for a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer that won't clog pores.</li>
    <li><h5>Combination skin:</h5> Use a moisturizer that balances oil production in the T-zone while hydrating dry areas.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Sun Protection:</h2>
  <p>Regardless of skin type, it's important to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 daily to protect the skin from harmful UV rays.</p>
  
  <h2>Additional Steps:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><h5>Exfoliation:</h5> Depending on your skin type, incorporate a gentle exfoliator into your routine once or twice a week to remove dead skin cells and reveal a smoother complexion.</li>
    <li><h5>Serums/Treatments:</h5> Address specific skin concerns, such as acne, dark spots, or aging, with targeted serums or treatments.</li>
    <li><h5>Eye Cream:</h5> Apply a hydrating eye cream to the delicate skin around the eyes to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>*Remember, these are general guidelines, and it's important to listen to your skin's needs and adjust your routine accordingly. If you have specific skin concerns or conditions, it's best to consult with a dermatologist for personalized skincare advice.</p>
